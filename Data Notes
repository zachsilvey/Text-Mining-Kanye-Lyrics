-Did not include Diamonds from Sierra Leone bonus track on Late Registration in order to not duplicate Diamonds from Sierra Leone (Remix) on the main track list.
-Including Watch the Throne but may exlcude from some analyses due to it being a colaborative album
-Watch the Throne is technically both a Kanye West and Jay-Z album so Jay-Z is not considered a featured artist. May modify this in some analyses
-Going to consider Silver Surfer as a Skit even though it's techincally a phone conversation and not a scripted skit
-Some variables are not perfect, Featured arist needs QA
-All of the lights (interlude) is instrumental
